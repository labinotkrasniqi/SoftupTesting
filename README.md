After downloading Katalon open it and follow the steps.

Open project : open the Softup folder wich you will find in this git repo
After opening the project under testcases you will see the testcases that can be executed.
After opening a testcase on the bottom select script view to see the code

To run a testcase just press the play button on the top middle ( It will run on firefox by default so make sure that is installed, to change it go to Project-> settings-> execution and change the default browser to chrome).
